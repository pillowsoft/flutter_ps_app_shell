# Changelog

## 0.7.31 - 2025-10-03

### Fixed
- **🐛 CupertinoPageScaffold Content Sliding Under Navigation Bar (v0.7.30 Regression)**: Fixed content sliding under navigation bar instead of appearing below it
  - **Root Cause**: v0.7.30 wrapped `CupertinoPageScaffold` in `Container` to extend background into safe areas, but this prevented scaffold's automatic content positioning logic from working
  - **Widget Hierarchy Problem (v0.7.30)**:
    ```
    Container (wrapper) ← Takes over layout control
      └─ CupertinoPageScaffold ← Can't add padding for nav bar
          └─ Content ← Slides under nav bar
    ```
  - **Solution**:
    - Moved `Container` **inside** `CupertinoPageScaffold` child instead of wrapping it
    - Added `SafeArea` with selective insets:
      - `top: false` - Navigation bar handles top spacing
      - `bottom: false` - Allow background extension to home indicator
      - `left/right: true` - Keep horizontal safe areas
    - Set scaffold `backgroundColor: Colors.transparent` (Container handles color)
  - **Widget Hierarchy (v0.7.31)**:
    ```
    CupertinoPageScaffold (controls layout) ✅
      └─ Container (background color) ✅
          └─ SafeArea (selective insets) ✅
              └─ Content (properly positioned)
    ```
  - **Changes**:
    - Modified `cupertino_widget_factory.dart` lines 141-161 (with bottom navigation)
    - Modified `cupertino_widget_factory.dart` lines 200-215 (without bottom navigation)
  - **Impact**:
    - ✅ Navigation bar content positioning fixed (content appears below nav bar)
    - ✅ Home indicator background extension preserved (v0.7.30 fix maintained)
    - ✅ Status bar styling preserved (v0.7.28/29 fixes maintained)
  - Reported by developer: "Container wrapper prevents CupertinoPageScaffold from positioning content below navigation bar"


## 0.7.30 - 2025-10-03

### Fixed
- **🐛 SafeArea Blocking iOS Home Indicator Background (v0.7.29 Critical Fix)**: Fixed v0.7.29 which still showed black bars because SafeArea wrapper prevented Container background extension
  - **Root Cause**: `app_shell.dart:138` wrapped ALL mobile scaffolds in SafeArea unconditionally, blocking Container (v0.7.29) from extending into safe area insets
  - **Widget Hierarchy Problem**:
    ```
    SafeArea (app_shell.dart) ← Blocks extension!
      └─ Container (background) ← Can't reach safe areas
          └─ CupertinoPageScaffold
    ```
  - **Solution**:
    - Conditionally apply SafeArea based on UI factory type
    - CupertinoWidgetFactory: No SafeArea wrapper (let Container extend into safe areas)
    - Material/ForUI: Keep SafeArea wrapper (they need it)
    - CupertinoPageScaffold handles safe areas for content internally
  - **Changes**:
    - Added `CupertinoWidgetFactory` import to `app_shell.dart`
    - Modified SafeArea logic to check UI factory type (lines 139-143)
    - iOS Cupertino: Returns unwrapped scaffold (Container extends to safe areas)
    - Material/ForUI: Returns SafeArea-wrapped scaffold (unchanged)
  - **Impact**:
    - iOS Cupertino: Container background finally extends into safe areas ✅
    - Android Cupertino: Navigation bar styling preserved (v0.7.28) ✅
    - Material/ForUI: SafeArea protection maintained ✅
  - Reported by developer: "SafeArea wrapper prevents Container background from extending into safe areas"


## 0.7.29 - 2025-10-03

### Fixed
- **🐛 iOS Home Indicator Black Bar (v0.7.28 Fix)**: Corrected v0.7.28 fix which didn't work on iOS
  - **Root Cause**: `systemNavigationBarColor` is "Only honored in Android versions O and greater" - completely ignored on iOS
  - **iOS Reality**: Home indicator color auto-adapts based on background color beneath it, cannot be directly styled
  - **Solution**:
    - Split `SystemUiOverlayStyle` into platform-specific configurations (iOS vs Android)
    - Removed iOS-incompatible `systemNavigationBarColor` properties for iOS
    - Wrapped `CupertinoPageScaffold` with `Container` to ensure background extends behind home indicator area
  - **Impact**:
    - iOS home indicator area now properly shows scaffold background color
    - Android navigation bar continues working correctly with v0.7.28 fix
    - Status bar styling works correctly on both platforms
  - Reported by developer: "v0.7.28 fix doesn't work for iOS because systemNavigationBarColor is Android-only"


## 0.7.28 - 2025-10-03

### Fixed
- **🐛 System UI Overlay Black Bars**: Fixed black bars appearing in status bar and home indicator areas across all three UI systems
  - **Root Cause**: Scaffold implementations didn't configure system UI overlay styling, causing iOS/Android system regions to display black instead of matching scaffold background
  - **Solution**: Wrapped all scaffold returns with `AnnotatedRegion<SystemUiOverlayStyle>` to match system UI colors to scaffold backgrounds
  - **Affected Files**: `cupertino_widget_factory.dart`, `material_widget_factory.dart`, `forui_widget_factory.dart`
  - **Impact**: Status bar and navigation bar areas now properly match scaffold background colors with correct icon brightness across Cupertino, Material, and ForUI
  - Reported in bug analysis showing black system UI regions on light-colored scaffolds


## 0.7.27 - 2025-10-02

### Fixed
- **🐛 Cupertino Button Padding Consistency**: Fixed padding inconsistency between filled and outlined buttons
  - Added missing `padding: EdgeInsets.zero` to `outlinedButton()`
  - Previously, `outlinedButton()` used CupertinoButton's default 16px padding + Container's 16px padding = 32px total
  - Now all button types consistently use zero button padding + Container's 16px padding = 16px total
  - Ensures uniform visual width across all button types (filled, outlined, with/without icons)

## 0.7.26 - 2025-10-02

### Fixed
- **🐛 Cupertino Button Width Constraints (Correct Fix)**: Fixed v0.7.25 implementation that used wrong pattern
  - **Root Cause**: v0.7.25 wrapped CupertinoButton in SizedBox, but CupertinoButton doesn't respect parent width constraints
  - **Correct Solution**: Container with `width: double.infinity` must be the button's **child**, not its wrapper
  - Applied correct pattern from `outlinedButton()` to `button()` and `buttonWithIcon()`
  - Set `padding: EdgeInsets.zero` on CupertinoButton.filled
  - Added Container(width: double.infinity) as button's child with proper padding
  - Now matches the pattern used by outlined buttons for consistency
  - CupertinoButton.filled now properly expands to fill available width
  - ⚠️ Note: Still had padding inconsistency in `outlinedButton()` - fixed in v0.7.27

## 0.7.25 - 2025-10-02 [DEPRECATED - INCORRECT FIX]

### Fixed
- **🐛 Filled Button Width Constraints**: ⚠️ This release used incorrect approach (SizedBox wrapper)
  - Used wrong pattern: wrapped button in SizedBox instead of Container as child
  - CupertinoButton doesn't expand with SizedBox wrapper - fix didn't work
  - See v0.7.26 for correct implementation

## 0.7.24 - 2025-10-02

### Fixed
- **🐛 Outlined Button Width Constraints**: Fixed outlined buttons not respecting parent width constraints
  - `outlinedButton()` and `outlinedButtonWithIcon()` in CupertinoWidgetFactory now expand to fill available width
  - Added `width: double.infinity` to Container wrappers
  - Added proper text/icon centering (Center widget and MainAxisAlignment.center)
  - Fixed same issue in ForUIWidgetFactory for consistency across all UI systems
  - Buttons wrapped in `SizedBox(width: double.infinity)` now display with uniform width
  - Resolves visual inconsistency when mixing filled and outlined buttons in layouts

## 0.7.14 - 2025-09-07

### Fixed
- **🐛 DatabaseService Race Condition**: Fixed critical race condition in query methods
  - `findAll()`, `findWhere()`, and `read()` were returning empty results on initial query
  - Methods were synchronously reading signal values before WebSocket responses arrived
  - Now uses InstantDB's `queryOnce()` API which properly waits for initial data load
  - This ensures reliable data retrieval on first call instead of empty results
  - Root cause: Synchronous read of reactive signal before async data population

## 0.7.13 - 2025-09-06

### Fixed
- **🐛 ForUI Dialog Compilation**: Fixed compilation errors in ForUIWidgetFactory dialog implementations
  - Replaced ForUI component references with Material equivalents
  - Used LinearProgressIndicator instead of FProgress
  - Applied custom styling to maintain ForUI design aesthetics
  - Ensures compatibility when ForUI package is not available

## 0.7.12 - 2025-09-06

### Added
- **🎯 Enhanced Dialog System**: Comprehensive dialog handling improvements based on developer feedback
  - `DialogHandle` class for managing dialog lifecycle with state updates
  - `LoadingDialogController` for loading dialogs with message updates
  - `ProgressDialogController` for progress tracking with step management
  - Safe dialog dismissal methods: `dismissDialog()`, `hasDialog()`, `dismissDialogIfShowing()`
  - Built-in loading dialog: `showLoadingDialog()` with updatable messages
  - Progress dialog support: `showProgressDialog()` with step tracking
  - Platform-adaptive implementations across Material, Cupertino, and ForUI

### Enhanced
- **🚀 NavigationService Dialog Awareness**: Navigation service now coordinates with dialog system
  - Dialog state tracking to prevent navigation conflicts
  - `safeNavigate()` method that handles dialog dismissal
  - Before-navigate callbacks for dialog auto-dismissal
  - Context stack management for modal awareness
  - Prevention of "black screen" issue from incorrect Navigator.pop() calls
  - `canNavigate()` check for dialog-aware navigation guards

### Developer Experience
- **📝 Simplified Dialog Patterns**: No more manual Navigator context confusion
  - Automatic handling of `rootNavigator: true` context
  - Dialog handles for easy dismissal without context issues
  - Reactive state updates for loading and progress messages
  - Integration with GoRouter navigation prevents conflicts

## 0.7.11 - 2025-09-05

### Fixed
- **🚨 CRITICAL: InstantDB Transaction API Usage**: Fixed DatabaseService methods using incorrect InstantDB transaction builder API
  - `create()` now uses `tx[collection].create(data)` instead of `tx[collection][id].update(data)`
  - `delete()` now uses `tx[collection][id].delete()` instead of `_db!.delete(id)`
  - This generates proper `OperationType.add` and `OperationType.delete` operations
  - **Root Cause**: Using wrong operation types caused InstantDB sync engine to skip all attributes, sending transactions with "0 steps"
  - **Impact**: Fixes complete failure of data synchronization to InstantDB server - all CRUD operations now work correctly
  - Transactions now send proper step counts and data persists to cloud successfully

## 0.7.10 - 2025-09-05

### Fixed
- **🐛 InstantDB Query Syntax Error**: Fixed critical bug in DatabaseService.read() method
  - Corrected InstantDB query syntax by wrapping field conditions in 'where' clause
  - Query now properly uses `{'$': {'where': {'id': id}}}` instead of `{'$': {'id': id}}`
  - This fix resolves document retrieval failures that also affected update() and delete() operations
  - All CRUD operations now function correctly with InstantDB backend

## 0.7.9 - 2025-09-05

### Fixed
- **🐛 Navigation Rail Vertical Alignment**: Fixed navigation rail items being vertically centered in Material and Cupertino modes
  - Material: Wrapped NavigationRail's SingleChildScrollView in Align widget with topCenter alignment

  - Enables pre-initialization for onboarding, auth checks, and testing scenarios
  - Apps no longer crash with "Type X is already registered inside GetIt" error
  - Clear logging indicates which services were skipped vs newly registered
  - Fully backward compatible with existing apps


## 0.7.2 - 2025-09-04

### Changed
- **💄 Improved CupertinoTabBar Icon Centering**: Added 4px top padding to tab bar icons for better visual balance
  - Icons now appear properly centered within the tab bar height
  - Equal spacing above and below creates a more polished appearance
  - Applies to both regular and active icon states
  - Fixes visual issue where icons appeared too close to the top edge


## 0.7.1 - 2025-09-04

### Fixed
